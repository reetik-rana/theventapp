The Vent
This is a simple, anonymous thought-sharing app built for a small community.

-- Our Mission --
The Vent provides a space for users to share their thoughts, feelings, and opinions openly and honestly, without the pressure of a public identity. Our goal is to foster a supportive environment where authenticity is encouraged.

-- Key Features --
Pseudo-Anonymous Posting: Share your thoughts using a custom username(don't include your real name) and an anonymous emoji. Other users cannot see your real name or personal information.

Simple & Secure: A straightforward interface for posting and replying to thoughts. The app is built using modern technologies to ensure a smooth and secure experience.

Like & Reply: Engage with posts by liking them or adding your own anonymous replies.

-- Technical Details & Anonymity --
User Authentication: The app uses Google authentication to create a user account, which is linked to a unique User ID (UID) in our backend database.

Data Storage: When a post is created, it is associated with your unique User ID in the backend.

Transparency: While your identity is kept private from other users, anyone with administrative access to the app's backend can view a post's User ID and link it to the corresponding user account. We do not use this information to track or identify individual users.
